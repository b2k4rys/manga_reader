        Hidden in plain sight, an age-old conflict rages on. Supernatural
        monsters known as "Curses" terrorize humanity from the shadows, and
        powerful humans known as "Jujutsu" sorcerers use mystical arts to
        exterminate them. When high school student Yuuji Itadori finds a
        dried-up finger of the legendary Curse Sukuna Ryoumen, he suddenly finds
        himself joining this bloody conflict. Attacked by a Curse attracted to
        the finger's power, Yuuji makes a reckless decision to protect himself,
        gaining the power to combat Curses in the process but also unwittingly
        unleashing the malicious Sukuna into the world once more. Though Yuuji
        can control and confine Sukuna to his own body, the Jujutsu world
        classifies Yuuji as a dangerous, high-level Curse who must be
        exterminated. Detained and sentenced to death, Yuuji meets Satoru
        Gojou—a teacher at Jujutsu High School—who explains that despite his
        imminent execution, there is an alternative for him. Being a rare vessel
        to Sukuna, if Yuuji were to die, then Sukuna would perish too.
        Therefore, if Yuuji were to consume the many other remnants of Sukuna,
        then Yuuji's subsequent execution would truly eradicate the malicious
        demon. Taking up this chance to make the world safer and live his life
        for a little longer, Yuuji enrolls in Jujutsu High, jumping headfirst
        into a harsh and unforgiving battlefield. [Written by MAL Rewrite]
